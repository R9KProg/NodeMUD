# NodeMUD

## Information
This project is an attempt to redesign the classic MUD-style computer game around modern technologies.
In place of a telnet client is your web browser. In place of a C based server is Node.JS, hence the name.

In addition, it should be noted that this is a learning project for me. It is my first Node project, my first project involving any sort of network programming, albeit not anything to tricky, and my first attempt at making anything with extensibility in mind.
Indeed, extensibility is my number 1 concern with this project. I plan not to have any actual levels, maps, npcs etc in this repo. Instead, this repo will be solely the game engine, and another repo will contain the game content once I have created that.
My goal with this project is to offer an alternative to those who wish to make a MUD game from the ancient, poorly-aged software designed for use with deprecated technologies.

## Installation
It is quite simple at the moment, but there will be more in the future.
For now, all that is required is:
npm install
node index
And your instance will be running on your IP at the port 3000.
